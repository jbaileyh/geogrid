Title: Assigning real spaces to hexagonal and regular grids
Version: 0.0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Joseph", "Bailey", email = "jbailey@futurecities.catapult.org.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package helps you to turn irregular polygons (such as geographical regions) into regular grids. 
    It enables the generation of regular (square) and hexagonal grids through the package 'sp' and then assigns 
    the content of the existing polygons to the new grid in three different ways. This prevents the need for manual
    generation of hexgrids or regular grids that are supposed to reflect existing geography.
